But in the US, the president holds all the executive power ‚Äî they‚Äôre the head of government AND the head of state. And there are lots of other presidents like that around the world, but they‚Äôre almost always elected by popular vote or by a national legislature.

"In my country, the xps 13 is actually 250$  more expensive while having not as powerful hardwares, namely smaller ssd and weaker gpu. So I went with it. I'm happy so far. The thermal, for anyone is questioning, is really good, it rarely get hotter than 70¬∞C, both cpu and gpu. The gpu is mx250 2gb 10w variant, nothing extremely powerful about it but I could play CS:GO and GTA V. It also handle large PSD file in Photoshop perfectly. I'm a designer, and the pen come with the laptop and the second screen are very useful. Oh, the battery life is excellent to, really impressive. The only thing I don't like about this laptop is the trackpad, it's so cramped and small, the keyboard is surprisingly good though, the key switch is awesome, but I don't mind it that much because I use external mouse and keyboard. And another problem is the lid of the laptop, those metallic circular brush patterns look cool but it is a fingerprints magnet and scratches fairly easily, also some parts of the lid got slight discoloration because of my sweat.

She said that people are walking around with the virus and showing no signs... and at the end of this video she said that don't wear face mask?? I was really upset and this video was really interesting since i have heard that sentences at the end. I think that is why coronavirus spreadouts faster at Europe and America.

"The brain is never the same at all time because of what needs to happen to retain and develop itself if you are undergoing major neurological growth. In the case of neurodegeneration the brain starts malfunctioning and becoming inoperational. Anyways the important point is that the brain almost always undergoes change and even if it is dead it will still undergo decompostion. And if we also consider spacetime warpages that result from them having to obey the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the constant changes in the momenta and position because of this principle, it never is the same as before.",neutral,Neutral,-2
