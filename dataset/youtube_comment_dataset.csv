A young fisherman is singing to his kids while sitting on the dock. A business man comes by and sees a half empty bucket of fish. He goes to the fisher and says “why aren’t you fishing?” The young man says “I’ve fished enough to feed my family”. The business man says “you should fish more”. The young man says “for what?” The older man says “so you can buy a bigger boat and catch more fish”. The young fisher says “then what?”. The older man says “so you can have enough money to start a company” “then what?” Says the young man. “Then you can have enough money to have a huge business”. Again the young man says “then what?” The older man replies “then you can retire and enjoy life by the sea with your children” the young man says “what do you think I’m doing now?” And resumes his singing.,neutral,Neutral,-2

"Fact check: There are a few other democracies that use an electoral college system to pick their president! But what sets the US apart from them is the president’s role. In many countries, the president is less important than the prime minister, or shares power with the prime minister, or is purely a figurehead. But in the US, the president holds all the executive power — they’re the head of government AND the head of state. And there are lots of other presidents like that around the world, but they’re almost always elected by popular vote or by a national legislature. No other democracy follows the US’s example of using an entirely separate body of “electors” to pick the country’s sole leader.",neutral,Neutral,-2

"The thing I find interesting is how many people believe the US is a democracy. Though thought of as an idea for our government system ultimately they decided against it. Noting that several other governments who had used the system failed in the end. Therefore the founding fathers decided to go with a Representative Republic. So the US isn't really a democracy at all, it's a republic. Hence why we don't vote presidents in with popular vote and instead we use the Electoral College.",neutral,Neutral,-2

Every citizens vote should count equally. This is the only way to create equality, which is supposedly what the US is all about.... in reality... not so much.",negative,Anger,0

This is exactly why we need to educate our future generations about the electoral college. This was put into place to give the smaller states equal representation in our election process. It helps by not allowing a state like California to control the election with such a large population. This gives us checks and balances in our government.,neutral,Neutral,-2

"In my country, the xps 13 is actually 250$  more expensive while having not as powerful hardwares, namely smaller ssd and weaker gpu. So I went with it. I'm happy so far. The thermal, for anyone is questioning, is really good, it rarely get hotter than 70°C, both cpu and gpu. The gpu is mx250 2gb 10w variant, nothing extremely powerful about it but I could play CS:GO and GTA V. It also handle large PSD file in Photoshop perfectly. I'm a designer, and the pen come with the laptop and the second screen are very useful. Oh, the battery life is excellent to, really impressive. The only thing I don't like about this laptop is the trackpad, it's so cramped and small, the keyboard is surprisingly good though, the key switch is awesome, but I don't mind it that much because I use external mouse and keyboard. And another problem is the lid of the laptop, those metallic circular brush patterns look cool but it is a fingerprints magnet and scratches fairly easily, also some parts of the lid got slight discoloration because of my sweat.

"The ""no mask"" advice was the recommended directive at the time this was recorded. By April, professionals were explaining that face masks were critical in slowing the spread of the virus. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater; the presenter does an excellent job of explaining what coronavirus is.  I am writing this on July 16, when the number of COVID cases surpassed 75,000 in a single day and there have been 137,000 deaths to date.  Still skeptical?

She said that people are walking around with the virus and showing no signs... and at the end of this video she said that don't wear face mask?? I was really upset and this video was really interesting since i have heard that sentences at the end. I think that is why coronavirus spreadouts faster at Europe and America. People should protect themself by wearing face mask. Not only for sick people but also for normal people. Thanks!,negative,Neutral,-2

"The brain is never the same at all time because of what needs to happen to retain and develop itself if you are undergoing major neurological growth. In the case of neurodegeneration the brain starts malfunctioning and becoming inoperational. Anyways the important point is that the brain almost always undergoes change and even if it is dead it will still undergo decompostion. And if we also consider spacetime warpages that result from them having to obey the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the constant changes in the momenta and position because of this principle, it never is the same as before.",neutral,Neutral,-2
